# sv3c_video_embed
Example html code for embeding video from an SV3C SD7W-1080PS-HX outdoor camera

<b>Quick Start</b></br>
Edit line 9 of myvideo.html to point to your camera's ip address.  For example: var ip="192.168.1.25";

Load you new version of myfile.html on your web sever and it should work with most browsers. You should be prompted for your camera's username and password.</br></br>

I have been successful enbedding video with the Mac versions of Firefox, Safari and Chrome.  Safari on an iPad and iPhone work as well.  I tried on an older version of IE on Win7 and no joy.  The SV3C specific version of libde265.js appears to use a websockets interface which may predate my Win7 IE.  </br></br>
